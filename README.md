Vending Machine
==========


● Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted,
the vending machine should return the correct product.

● It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more
money if insufficient funds have been inserted.

● The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change
will be of denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2.

● There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.

● The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.
